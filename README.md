The basic idea behind docker is to make mulitple systems compactible for a particlular task. The same can be achieved by:-
1. Making an environment that is similar to the initial computer in which the program/ software is developed.
2. Making a virtual Machine.

The advantage of using docker is that it is light weight and provides similar functionality as virtual machines.

## Let's look at a comparison with Virtual Machine and docker

Docker is tool which is used to automate the deployment of applications in light weight containers so that many applications can work efficiently in different environments.

## Docker Essential Components:-

Docker File 
- like a blueprint for building docker images.
Docker Image
- Template for running docker containers.
Containers
- Run in progress.

## Docker Commands
