# Docker-learnings

The basic idea behind docker is to make mulitple systems compactible for a particlular task. The same can be achieved by:-
1. Making an environment that is similar to the initial computer in which the program/ software is developed.
2. Making a virtual Machine.

The advantage of using docker is that it is light weight and provides similar functionality as virtual machines.

## Let's look at a comparison with Virtual Machine and docker

Docker is tool which is used to automate the deployment of applications in light weight containers so that many applications can work efficiently in different environments.

! dockerignore and gitignore are for ignoring the local dependency of the working hardware.
## Docker Essential Components:-

Docker File 
- like a blueprint for building docker images.
Docker Image
- Template for running docker containers.
Containers
- Run in progress.
Volume
- Dedicated folder on the host machine.
Docker compose 
- To run multiple docker containers at the same time.

## Docker Commands
docker ps -- list all the running containers in your system.
docker build -t tagname/demoapp:1.0 -- to make a docker image.
docker run id -- running a container
docker run -p 5000:8080  -- port forwarding.
docker volume create name -- to create a volume

# Importance of docker for data scientists
Improved and seamless container portability: Docker containers run without modification across any desktop, data center, or cloud environment.
Even lighter weight and more granular updates: Multiple processes can be combined within a single container. This makes it possible to build an application that can continue running while one of its parts is taken down for an update or repair.
Automated container creation: Docker can automatically build a container based on application source code.
Container versioning: Docker can track versions of a container image, roll back to previous versions, and trace who built a version and how. It can even upload only the deltas between an existing version and a new one.
Container reuse: Existing containers can be used as base images â€” essentially like templates for building new containers.
Shared container libraries: Developers can access an open-source registry containing thousands of user-contributed containers.
